This repository contains various projects I worked on during my time at university.
I'm recording them here as a personal archive and for anyone who might find them helpful or inspiring.
These projects were created as part of my coursework, labs, and self-initiated explorations throughout my undergraduate journey.
These projects are inspired by existing open-source or academic projects and were recreated or adapted as part of my learning process.
While these projects may not be production-ready, they represent the skills I developed and my enthusiasm for hands-on learning.
